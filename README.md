# About

MintJack is a BlackJack application intended to give users the experience of a real life casino. 
Users can join and leave the BlackJack table at will without affecting the flow of the game, 
and a chat built using Socket.io provides real-time messaging amongst players. Players can
choose an avatar to best represent them, and rapid dealing of hands ensures a nice pace to the
game. The app is responsive to a variety of screen sizes and will persist the login state through
page refereshes.
